// A data structure that is ordered. Difference between linked list and array is array has an index and linked list consist of nodes
// Each node has a value and a pointer.
// Head is beginning, Tail is the end. You also keep track of the length, not what is in the middle
// one node points to the next one, a skyscraper with no elevators. It cannot take you to the certain floor, you have to take the stairs 
// singly linked lists, each node only connects to one node, next to each other.
